# EmailQuestionnaire
Shortly, EmailQuestionnaire is a simple method to poll your contacts by sending them the form within the email.
Concretely, EmailQuestionnaire is a set of server tools and methods for client content to support you to send a questionnaire per email. The server tools are made as a web-application based on the Java Servlet specification; they store the questionnaires' answers in XML files and show the result as a tabulated HTML which can be easily copied to statistics programmes.

This whole project is under the Apache Public License, see [LICENSE.txt](license.txt).

For you to apply these tools, you shall need a servlet container such as [Apache Tomcat](http://tomcat.apache.org/) and some capability to edit HTML forms (easily acquired through the very many tutorials).

The project's documentation includes the following documents to get you started:
* [How to install?](docs/How-to-install.md) A description of the technical steps to install and configure the survey and results web-application, including write-rights.
* [How to create an email-questionnaire?](How-to-create-an-email-questionnaire.md) A description of the typical steps to create the HTML and use it in a mail that you can send to the persons being polled.
* [How to process results?](docs/How-to-process-results.md) A workflow description to ensure a swift and live analysis of the questionnaire results.
